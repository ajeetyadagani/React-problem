We use a functional component App to encapsulate the JSX code.
Inside the App component, we define a function handleAlert that triggers an alert when the button is clicked.
We use React Fragments (<>...</>) to wrap multiple JSX elements without adding an extra DOM node.
We create a paragraph element with the text "React is a JavaScript library".
We create a div element with the class name main and inline styles to add a border and padding.
Inside the div, we include another paragraph element with instructions and a button.
The button has an onClick event handler that calls the handleAlert function when clicked, triggering an alert with the message "Hello".
Optionally, you can add additional styling to the div element using inline styles to enhance its appearance.
