We define a functional component named Greeting that accepts message and name props.
Inside the component, we use JSX syntax to render a paragraph (<p>) element that combines the message and name props to display a greeting.
We use ReactDOM's render method to render the Greeting component with specific props ("Hello" for message and "Alice" for name) into the root element of the HTML document.
