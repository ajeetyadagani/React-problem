Importing React and ReactDOM: We import React and ReactDOM from the provided CDN links. These are necessary for creating and rendering React components.
Root Element: We have a <div> element with the id root. This is where our React component will be rendered.
TodoList Component:
We define a functional component TodoList using the function keyword. This component represents the todo list application.
Inside the TodoList component, we use the useState hook to manage state. We have two state variables: todos to store the list of todo items, and newTodo to store the text of the new todo item being added.
The addTodo function is responsible for adding a new todo item to the list. It checks if the newTodo is not empty before adding it to the todos array.
The toggleTodo function toggles the completion status of a todo item when its checkbox is clicked.
The removeTodo function removes a todo item from the list when its delete button is clicked.
Inside the JSX, we render an input field for adding new todo items, a button to add the todo, and an unordered list (<ul>) to display the todo items.
We use the map function to iterate over the todos array and render a list item (<li>) for each todo item. Each list item contains a checkbox to mark the todo item as completed, the todo text, and a delete button to remove the todo item.
We use the defaultChecked attribute to set the initial checked state of the checkbox, and the onChange event to handle toggling the completion status of the todo item.
The todo text is displayed with a line-through style if the todo item is completed, indicating that it's done.
Rendering the TodoList Component: We use ReactDOM.render to render the TodoList component into the root div.
