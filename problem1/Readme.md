Reflection on manipulating the DOM using traditional JavaScript vs React's approach:

Traditional JavaScript DOM manipulation: -Requires selecting DOM elements using methods like getElementById, querySelector, etc. -Involves directly modifying DOM properties, attributes, or contents using methods like innerHTML, setAttribute, etc. -Code can become complex and error-prone, especially for large and dynamic UIs. -UI logic and presentation are often mixed, leading to poor separation of concerns.

React's approach: -Uses React components and elements to describe the UI declaratively. -Encourages separation of concerns by allowing UI logic and presentation to be encapsulated into reusable components. -Improves code readability and maintainability by providing a more declarative and component-based architecture. -React's virtual DOM reconciliation algorithm optimizes DOM updates, resulting in better performance compared to manual DOM manipulation in many cases.

Overall, React's approach offers several benefits including improved code organization, better maintainability, and enhanced performance.
